1) Think about the most suited ML algo - DONE (Random Forest for accuracy, maybe DecisionTreeRegressor? pg. 13 AML1920_Adv_Lecture_1, maybe a Hard Voting Classifier? pg. 38 AML1920_Adv_Lecture_1)
2) Define features - DONE (tipologia, genere, bagno, cucina, salotto, balcone, zona)
3) Define target - DONE (euro)
4) Adequate text features to numerical ones
5) Feature scaling (pg. 34 AML1920_Basic_Lecture2)
6) Mean normalisation (pg.36 AML1920_Basic_Lecture2)
7) TVT splitting (pg. 32 AML1920_Basic_Lecture5) or k-fold Cross-Validation (pg. 44 AML1920_Adv_Lecture_5)
8) Look for correlations (pg. 29 AML1920_Adv_Lecture_5)
9) Implement ROC curve and AUC maybe lately? (pag. 4 ALM1920_Basic_Lecture7)
10) Implement bagging and/or pasting? (pg. 42 AML1920_Adv_Lecture_1)
11) Fine tuning with Grid Search/Randomised Search maybe? (pg. 51 AML1920_Adv_Lecture_5)
12) Evaluate the system (pg. 56 AML1920_Adv_Lecture_5)
