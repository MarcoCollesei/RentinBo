The RentinBo project I here present is intended to be a demostration of the workflow behind the application of a Machine Learnign algorithm.
The scope of this project is to train a classification algorithm, with real data from current housing situation in Bologna, to predict the possible range of euros that can be asked to rent a single or double room in Bologna.
In order to work with a true dataset I have personally collected ads for rooms during August 2020, surfing the website "Subito.it".
The only criterium to select ads has been to collect the same amount of informatios for single and double rooms, namely 100 and 100.
I selected few main features on the base of which lately I have trained the algorithm.

- Type
  - As mentioned before only single and double rooms have been considered.

- Gender
  - In many cases ads were explicitly oriented for one gender or the other, as well as both together.

- Position
  - Reporting the exact location of a room would have been inefficient without a precise system of coordinates and a metric, hence I opted for dividing the city according to the zones defined below (see references for the list).
